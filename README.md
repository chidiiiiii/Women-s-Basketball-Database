# Huntington Womens Basketball Database
The Huntington University Women’s Basketball Team is a college athletic program that competes in the Crossroads League of the NAIA. The team represents the university at both regional and national levels, focusing on strong athletic performance, academic success, and personal growth.

The coaching staff works together to develop each player’s skills through regular practices, competitive games, and team-building activities. The program recruits student-athletes from many different areas and keeps detailed records of players, games, and season statistics to track progress and prepare for future competition.

Currently, much of the team’s information—such as player rosters, game results, and individual performance statistics—is stored across multiple spreadsheets or tracked manually. This makes it difficult to quickly analyze data, monitor trends, or generate accurate reports for media releases and scouting purposes. By implementing a centralized relational database, the Huntington Women’s Basketball Team can efficiently manage all relevant data in one system. This ensures that coaches, staff, and athletic administrators have easy access to up-to-date information that supports better decision-making, performance tracking, and long-term player development.

From a user’s perspective, the Huntington University Women’s Basketball Database will serve as a central hub for organizing and retrieving all information related to the team’s operations. Coaches will use the system to manage player data, including profiles, academic information, and positions on the team. Before each season, coaches can update the roster, record new recruits, and assign players to roles or positions. During the season, they can log game results, update player statistics such as points and free throws, and review past performance to adjust training strategies.

Athletic administrators can use the database to schedule games, record opponents, and track results throughout the season. They can also generate reports showing overall team performance, win-loss records, and player averages to share with the athletic department or for public updates. The database makes it easy to compare data from different seasons, helping staff analyze team growth and identify standout players for awards or recognition.
